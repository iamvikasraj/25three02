# SuperCard Experiment 🎴

An experimental Three.js project showcasing Super Money credit card designs with stunning 3D animations and realistic materials.

## 🧪 About This Experiment

This is a technical exploration of Three.js capabilities, focusing on:
- **3D Credit Card Rendering** - Realistic materials and lighting
- **Smooth Animations** - Elastic entrance effects with overshoot
- **Interactive 3D Controls** - Orbit controls for immersive viewing
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficient rendering techniques

## 🎨 Credit Card Designs

This project showcases designs inspired by **Super Money** credit cards:
- **Super Money Blue Card** - Premium blue design with modern aesthetics
- **Black Card Variant** - Exclusive black card with luxury finish

> **Note:** Credit card designs are inspired by Super Money's aesthetic. This is an experimental project for learning Three.js and 3D web development.
